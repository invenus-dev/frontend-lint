## Linting Vue App

### Deviations from global Readme

- Vue init via `npm init vue@latest` offers a few nice bits regarding linting:
  - offers ESLint (ticked yes)
  - offers Prettier (ticked yes)
- I added a `.prettierrc` file
- there is recommended tooling for vscode - `johnsoncodehk.volar` + `johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin`. Unfortunately both have issues not resolvable without Typescript config - see https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/592
