# Frontend Lint

## About

Aim of this repository is to create sensible defaults for linters in JS/CSS scope of projects.

## Tooling

We are using the following tools:

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - all basic formatting
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - JavaScript, TypeScript
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) - CSS

## Scopes

We are testing in various scopes:

- React (through `npx create-react-app`)
- Vue 3 (through `npm init vue@latest`)
- Svelte (through `npx degit sveltejs/template`)

All of them with and without TypeScript enabled.

## Structure

All projects reside individually in a folder of this repository.

In the root level, we only have a `.nvmrc` file which fixes Node to version 16, and this Readme file.
