## Linting Vue App with TypeScript

### Deviations from global Readme

- Vue init via `npm init vue@latest`, the only difference from `vue-app` was selected TS
  - offers ESLint (ticked yes)
  - offers Prettier (ticked yes)
- I added a `.prettierrc` file
- there is recommended tooling for vscode - `johnsoncodehk.volar` + `johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin`. And this issue: see https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/592 - it did not manifested in TS version.
